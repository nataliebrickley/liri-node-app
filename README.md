# LIRI
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.  
LIRI can search for concerts (using Bands in Town), songs(using Spotify), and movies(using OMDB)!  
## 1. Concerts  
To search for a concert, simply use the keyword *concert-this* followed by the artist as shown below:  
*concert-this* will provide the following information about a concert:
+ Name of the venue
+ Venue location
+ Date of the Event

## 2. Songs

## 3. Movies 
To search for a movie, use the keyword *movie-this* followed by the title of the movie as shown below:  
*movie-this* will provide the following information about a movie: 
   * Title of the movie.
   * Year the movie came out.

## 3. Random 
Lastly, we can use the keyword *do-what-it-says* to execute the command stored in our random.txt file. For instance, if the text inside the random.txt file reads: *"spotify-this-song,'I Want it That Way'"* , then LIRI will run the code as if we had typed in *spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"*
